## Slack Slash Command Example

This repo demonstrates 3 approaches to handling Form POSTs in a similar way to handling JSON POSTs in a Spring Boot
app.

Check out (and please vote for) the Spring Boot Jira issue that would make all 3 of these approaches unnecessary.

For a deeper explanation, read the 
[blog post](https://afitnerd.com/2017/05/24/what-if-spring-boot-handled-forms-like-json/) about it.

You can also see a lively conversation that kicked all this off on
